# üöÄ MCP Server ‚Äì Model Context Protocol

**Welcome to the official open-source MCP Server.**  
This is the heart of Konstellation & CivicNet‚Äôs federated civic infrastructure‚Äîa modular, principle-driven server for running local, trusted, and agentic community AI.

---

## üß≠ What Is the MCP Server?

The MCP Server powers **neighborhood, city, or org-level ‚Äúnodes‚Äù** in the CivicNet/Konstellation grid. Each node:

- Ingests and validates local data (GIS, policy, community stories, public records)
- Hosts and orchestrates agentic models (reasoning, self-audit, simulation, role-play, etc.)
- Applies **civic principles** (equity, truth, privacy, transparency) to every query and output
- Publishes secure, documented APIs for dashboards, GIS clients, and external partners
- Federates with other MCP nodes to share knowledge while keeping local control

**Why?**  
So every community can own, govern, and continually improve their own civic intelligence‚Äîno black boxes, no vendor lock-in, no silent bias.

## üåå Key Features

- **LLM-Agnostic:** Plug in any modern language model (OpenAI, Anthropic, open source)
- **Cloud-Agnostic:** Deploy on your cloud, on-prem, edge, or local device
- **Principle Repository:** Define, audit, and evolve community principles in code
- **Modular Agentic Logic:** Supports chain-of-thought, self-reflection, role simulation, multi-agent debate, and more
- **Data Stewardship:** Fine-grained connectors for local, open, and federated civic data
- **Simulation-Ready:** Run ‚Äúwhat-if‚Äù scenarios and participatory simulations
- **Full Audit Trail:** Every output, agent step, and data source is logged and reviewable
- **Dockerized:** Easy container setup, local or distributed

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quickstart (Local Docker Compose)

1. **Clone the Repo:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/PublikPrinciple/civicnet-mcp-server.git
   cd civicnet-mcp-server
   ```

2. **Copy and edit your environment variables:**

   ```sh
   cp config/.env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your API keys, DB, LLM settings, etc.
   ```

3. **Start the MCP Server (plus optional data services):**

   ```sh
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

4. **View API Docs:**

   * Go to `http://localhost:4000/docs` (Swagger/OpenAPI by default)

## üõ†Ô∏è Core Concepts

### Principle Repository

* All outputs are checked, filtered, or rewritten to align with your community‚Äôs core principles (e.g., ‚Äúensure equity,‚Äù ‚Äúavoid harm,‚Äù ‚Äúcite sources‚Äù).
* Update principles via YAML/JSON in `/src/principles/`.

### Agents & Agentic Logic

* **Chain-of-Thought Agent:** Step-by-step logic for transparency
* **Self-Reflective Agent:** Checks its own bias, logic, and compliance
* **Role Simulation Agent:** Simulates debates (planner vs. resident), expert panels, or historical perspectives
* **Multi-Agent Collaboration:** Supports scenario testing, participatory budgeting, and red teaming
* Each agent‚Äôs logic is modular and composable (see `/src/agents/`).

### Data Layer

* **Connectors** for GIS, census, local CSVs, APIs, and more
* **Validation/Redaction** steps for privacy and data hygiene
* **Federation:** Share/selectively with trusted nodes (opt-in)

### Prompt & Scenario Templates

* All agentic reasoning is driven by prompt templates (see `/src/prompts/`)
* Write your own or use built-in civic case study and simulation templates

### Simulation

* Model ‚Äúwhat if?‚Äù futures (housing, climate, budget, etc.) using real and synthetic data
* Outputs are interactive and principle-audited

---

## üîë Example Use Cases

* **Generate a ‚ÄúDurham Housing Crisis‚Äù case study with maps, timelines, and equity analysis, ready for GIS and public review**
* **Support a participatory budgeting simulation with role-played debate between community agents**
* **Publish a plain-language, principle-aligned data API for local dashboards**
* **Audit all outputs for bias, error, and community principles (with logs and feedback)**
* **Federate with other neighborhoods/cities to compare, remix, and improve local analyses**

---

## üßë‚Äçüíª For Developers

* **Languages:** TypeScript/Node.js by default, Python agent compatibility in roadmap
* **Contributing:** See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for branching, code style, and principle-alignment PR checks
* **Tests:** `npm test` (Jest), or run all with `docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up`

---

## üèõÔ∏è For Civic Data Stewards

* **Principle-Driven Governance:** Edit `/src/principles/` to update your node‚Äôs values
* **Logs & Audit:** Every answer is traceable (who asked, what data, which agents, what checks)
* **Open APIs:** Build your own GIS client, dashboard, or mobile app on top of the MCP Server‚Äôs endpoints

---

## üîí Security & Privacy

* Sensitive data is never shared or exposed without explicit principle-driven consent and redaction
* Each node is sandboxed; federation is always opt-in and auditable

---

## üåç Federation & Constellation

* **Konstellation Ready:** This server is designed to federate‚Äîpublish/share insights with other communities, cities, or regions while keeping full local governance and privacy
* **Federated queries:** Allow comparisons (e.g., ‚ÄúShow eviction rates across all neighborhoods‚Äù)

## üìò Swagger/OpenAPI Setup (API Endpoint Overview)

Add this to /src/api/routes.ts (sample):

import express from 'express';
import swaggerUi from 'swagger-ui-express';
import YAML from 'yamljs';

const router = express.Router();
const swaggerDocument = YAML.load('./config/swagger.yaml');

router.use('/docs', swaggerUi.serve, swaggerUi.setup(swaggerDocument));
export default router;

Sample swagger.yaml starter:
